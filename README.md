# semhelpinghands

An assortment of functions that I wrote for my own use
in structural equation modeling (SEM) (currently, only one function).
I have no plan to submit this package to CRAN, for now. I use a package to
store these unrelated functions such that I can make use of the help pages
and examples, to help my "future self" to know what they are.

Do not propose any functions to this package. If you have anything useful
for SEM, I recommend you to propose to `semTools`
(https://github.com/simsem/semTools). I also use `semTools` myself. This package
is just for things I need but not in `semTools` or other packages.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in anything in this package,
you are certainly welcome to install it and use them.
