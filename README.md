# semhelpinghands

Just a collection of any functions that I wrote for my own use
in structural equation modeling.
I have no plan to submit it to CRAN (for now). I use a package to
store these functions such that I can make use of the help pages
and examples, to help my "future self" to know what they are.

Do not propose any functions to this package. It is for personal
use (for now). If you have anything useful for SEM, I recommend
you to propose to `semTools` (https://github.com/simsem/semTools)
or similar packages.

Nevertheless, if you are interested in anything in this package,
you are certainly welcome to install it and use them.
