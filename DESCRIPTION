Description: An assortment of helper functions for doing
  structural equation
  modeling (SEM), mainly by 'lavaan' for now. Most of them
  are
  time-saving functions for common tasks in
  doing SEM and reading the output. This package
  is not for functions that
  implement advanced statistical procedures. It is a
  light-weight package for simple functions to simple
  tasks conveniently, as few dependencies as possible.
